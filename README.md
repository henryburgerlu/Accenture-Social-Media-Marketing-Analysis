This project was a part of the Accenture Dada Analysis job simulation program on Forage: https://www.theforage.com/simulations/accenture-nam/data-analytics-mmlb

# Objective:

The goal of this project is to conduct data analysis for a mock social media marketing client to support them with their marketing campaign initiative. We look at three different dataset: Reactions, Reaction Types and Content, totally over 22,500 rows of data. 

# Approach to the project:

- An audit of their big data practice
- Recommendations for a successful IPO
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the
largest aggregate popularity

# Conclusion:

1. **Promote Top-Performing Content Categories by Month**
    
    To boost engagement rates, schedule content promotions based on the top 5 categories with the highest overall popularity. Rotating focus on these categories month by month can help maintain consistent user interest.
    
2. **Leverage Cross-Category Exposure**
    
    Mix highly popular content from top-performing categories with content from lower-performing ones. This strategy can potentially expand audience reach by introducing underexposed categories to users with established interests.
    
3. **Enhance Data Practices Before IPO**
    
    A preliminary audit suggests opportunities to strengthen the clientâ€™s big data capabilities. Investing in scalable infrastructure and more advanced analytics can improve decision-making, particularly as the company prepares for a potential IPO.
