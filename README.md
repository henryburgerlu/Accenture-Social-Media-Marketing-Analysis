This project was a part of the Accenture Dada Analysis job simulation program on Forage: https://www.theforage.com/simulations/accenture-nam/data-analytics-mmlb

# Objective:

**Key Strategic Recommendations:**

1. **Promote Top-Performing Content Categories by Month**
    
    To boost engagement rates, schedule content promotions based on the top 5 categories with the highest overall popularity. Rotating focus on these categories month by month can help maintain consistent user interest.
    
2. **Leverage Cross-Category Exposure**
    
    Mix highly popular content from top-performing categories with content from lower-performing ones. This strategy can potentially expand audience reach by introducing underexposed categories to users with established interests.
    
3. **Enhance Data Practices Before IPO**
    
    A preliminary audit suggests opportunities to strengthen the clientâ€™s big data capabilities. Investing in scalable infrastructure and more advanced analytics can improve decision-making, particularly as the company prepares for a potential IPO.
